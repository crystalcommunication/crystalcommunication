### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My pronouns are she/her. I mostly use this account to fork and/or contribute to projects that are already hosted on GitHub. I prefer to keep my contribution history private, but I certainly have a few public repositories you can look through. You'll find a lot more interesting stuff on [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/crystal).

All of my contributions to Gitea are on behalf of the [@Forgejo](https://github.com/forgejo) project. <3

Currently, my most notable repository is [the Magisk Twemoji installer](https://github.com/CrystalCommunication/Twemoji-systemless). If you've got Magisk installed on your phone, you can use it to replace the Android system emojis with Twitter emojis, because I prefer the way they look. You can also use this to add the new Unicode emojis to your device if your operating system has not been updated to support them.

Thanks for dropping by!
